# Architecture

`no-warden` is the reusable protocol and business-rules crate. It borrows input
strings, models wire data without an allocator, classifies routes, validates
supported payloads, and applies ownership and lifecycle rules through storage
traits. It has no HTTP, database, filesystem, RNG, clock, or crypto implementation.

Adapters authenticate requests and supply identities to the core. A trusted
identity must come from verified session credentials, never from request JSON.
Storage adapters must enforce atomicity where business operations require it.
They preserve encrypted fields and unknown wire fields without decrypting them.

The standalone Rust server will provide a local SQLite implementation and the
transport and cryptographic host services required to exercise real clients.
Allocations in this host do not change the core's allocation-free contract.

An embedded consumer can provide fixed-capacity storage and serialize responses
into a caller-owned buffer. Feature unification in an embedding application must
not accidentally enable `serde`'s `std` or `alloc` features for the core target.
CI separately compiles the core for a target without an operating system.
